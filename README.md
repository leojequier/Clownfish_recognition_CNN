# Clownfish_recognition_CNN

1st semester project during my Molecular Life Science (MLS) Master at the University of Lausanne. This programm uses Convolutionnal Neural Networks to classify pictures of clown fishes (Amphiprion sp.).

The project is coded in python (version 3.7.1). The list of required packages are in ./'Packages_used.txt'. 

You can start by taking a look at the final report of my project, ./'report - LÃ©onard Jequier.pdf'. Otherwise, the different folders contains :

* Networks : The scripts defining the architecture of the networks (net*.py), allowing to train them (net*.py), test the resulting network (stat*.py)
  - test
